This repository serves as an isolated guide to getting the ST-Link hardware to work on a Windows computer using WSL.

There are two steps to this process:
  1. Setting up the ST-Link hardware and software
  2. Giving WSL access to the ST-Link.

These are in order of importance, as WSL will not recognize the ST-Link hardware until it has been properly initialized.
